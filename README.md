# Merge-Sort-vs-Radix-Sort
In this repository i want to publish my experiment to know which one is the best between merge sort and radix sort.

I make some code in python language to test the function with random data in range 1 - 100 with 100, 1.000, 10.000, 100.000, 1.000.000 amount of data.

The code i run with python notebook that i test with jupyter notebook in my laptop with spesification :
  Processor : Intel Core I7-7700HQ
  RAM       : 8GB DDR4-2400MHz
  Harddisk  : 1TB 7200RPM
